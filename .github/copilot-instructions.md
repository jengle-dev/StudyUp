# Copilot Instructions

## Project Setup

1. **.NET 8**
   - Ensure you have .NET 8 SDK installed. You can download it from the official [.NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).

2. **ASP.NET Core**
   - Use ASP.NET Core for the backend of the web application. It provides a robust framework for building web apps and APIs.

3. **Angular**
   - For the frontend, use Angular. It is a powerful framework for building dynamic web applications.
   - Suggested frameworks to make design easy:
     - **Angular Material**: A UI component library for Angular developers.

4. **SOLID Principles**
   - Follow SOLID principles to ensure the code is modular, maintainable, and scalable.
     - **Single Responsibility Principle**: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
     - **Open/Closed Principle**: Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
     - **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
     - **Interface Segregation Principle**: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
     - **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

5. **Documentation and Comments**
   - Document the code with clear and clean comments.
   - Use XML comments for public members to generate API documentation.
   - Ensure that comments explain the purpose of the code and any complex logic.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure to set up a local SQL database for development.
- Use Entity Framework Core for database interactions.
- Follow best practices for security, performance, and scalability.
- Adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to reduce redundancy.
- Follow general development best practices to ensure code quality and maintainability.
